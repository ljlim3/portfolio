                                <p>From the get-go, I knew that graphs will be my close friends. But the challenge was that I had to visually communicate statistical information to users who may not have strong educational background. So I explored different graphs and created a few drafts of the initial design. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    For the first draft, I organized the number of questions asked by the Parent user in a pie chart, with the total shown in the center [Req. 1]. I used a bar graph for the number of readings in each language since there are only two categories (English or Spanish) [Req. 3]. All these took up one page per book.

                                I created a navigation bar with links to all the books. Clicking on any of the books displays the details of the book on the screen.

                                    I dedicated a section of the dashboard to displaying the question statistics bar graph for all books so that users can easily compare the statistics between different books.

                            As an alternative draft, instead of displaying the statistics upfront, I hid the statistics graphs into pop-up modals, which are brought up upon clicking a book from the Books menu. This would allow users to choose the information they want to see.

                                    In response to the feedback: to reduce the number of graphs, I removed the summary statistics bar 
                                    graph and placed a carousel on the left side of the screen next to the book menu with three 
                                    slides: one slide showing the questions asked (pie chart) [Req. 1], one showing the reading 
                                    requirement statistics (bar graph and pie chart) [Req. 3] and one showing the total time spent on 
                                    reading the book (number) [Req. 2]. This got rid of the modals and displayed the statistics on the

                                    Now, one of the challenges was visually communicating the app’s recommended requirement, whether users are meeting the requirement and the progress thereof [Req. 3]. I extracted out the Requirement 3 feature from the overall UI and drafted a few designs.

                                    For each book, specified in the middle column, I showed the Parent’s number of readings as a single bar graph that extends towards the left and the Child’s towards the right. In this design, how far each bar is reaching outwards is a visual representation of how much of the reading requirements are fulfilled by the Parent and the Child.                             <br><br>

                                    This time around, I had a more clear idea of what purpose the dashboard is to serve. But of course, the challenge was using the limited space efficiently, in a way that displays all necessary information in the most compact form possible, in an organized and digestible manner. 
                                </p>

                                    I revamped the previous design and came up with a flip card design, dedicating a card to each book. Since there are two sides to each card and multiple cards can fit in a screen, this improved space efficiency. I placed the content of higher interest to the user on the front side and statistics on the back side. The only graph displayed is for the number of questions asked. I used icons like avatar and flags to represent users and language a book was read in.

                                        <li>3. For the minimum requirement, both Parent and Child don’t have to read in English and Spanish. Each just has to read at least once, and at least once in Spanish and once in English (regardless of the reader) and in total 4 times.</li>

                                    My research team and I were very satisfied with the final design. Personally, I thought the requirement area 
                                    on the front side of the card was very compact but clearly communicated users’ progress and whether or not they 
                                    fulfilled it. And users can conveniently compare the question statistics between books by flipping the cards over. 
                                    Importantly, the user interviewees did not have hard time figuring out what different parts of the UI indicated. 
                                    So I went ahead and implemented it in React!

                                <p>The final design shows each book's information in a flip card, in which the front side 
                                shows the information identifying the book (e.g. title, image) and a visual representation
                                of the minimum requirement we want our users to fulfill for our study's data collection
                                purposes. The minimum requirement bar gets filled starting from either end, depending on who read.
                                The first and last bars are reserved for the parent and the child reader, respectively, as the it is required
                                that each read at least once. And the star next to the book title shows the quantity of readings, and 
                                the color turns yellow when the users have met the requirement for number of readings.
