                  Contemplating on the requirements, I have identified the problem to be organization of
                  two-dimensional data—one dimension being students and the other activities. Accordingly, I
                  deemed a table to be a good structure to visually present the data in a snapshot.
                  <br><br>
                  For students in rows and activities in columns, I indicated whether a student participated or
                  not in an activity using filled and hollow discs, respectively. Additionally, I included a column that
                  shows the total activities each student either participated or not participated in, based on the radio
                  button selection (Participated vs Not Participated) above the table. By default, this column is sorted
                  in descending order of the total to draw attention to students who have higher number of either
                  category
                  (participated or not participated). Clicking on a student’s name brings user to the details page that
                  shows
                  how students participated.
                  <!-- The dashboard shows a table that, for each student, shows all the activities in columns and whether or not they participated in an activity, indicated by different colors (e.g. green for participated and red for not participated). Each column gives user the option to view the table in ascending or descending order. The Week dropdown provides users with all the weeks, from beginning of the learning program to present.

                  less-friendly user experience because she would have to click each tab to see if the same student

            <p>The teacher was happy with the design. The final design provides tabs for each learning platform
              (Discussion Forum, Khan Academy, Teachable Robot) as well as the “All” tab, where user can see
              all the activities across all platforms. The participation status is color-coded
              (i.e. green for participated, red for not-participated, and gray for activities not yet started).
